# farmers-vs-volatility
Hedging strategy simulation for farmers facing commodity price volatility, using futures contracts and stochastic modeling. Applied quantitative finance with real-world impact.

Introduction:

Fruits, grains, and root vegetables — are staples we often overlook. Yet the COVID-19 crisis reminded us that farmers are underpaid despite being essential to our survival. This project aims to rethink agricultural efficiency by leveraging financial market tools. The core idea: if agricultural production were optimized like a trading strategy, we could reduce waste and ensure fairer compensation for farmers.

We simulate rational decision-making by modeling farmers as profit-maximizing agents subject to natural and policy constraints. Using convex optimization, the project estimates optimal crop allocation strategies under market-driven price dynamics. The end goal is to develop a smart pricing mechanism for trading soft commodities like rice, coffee, and chocolate, based on predicted supply-side behavior.

Assumptions & Economic Rationale:

This model rests on a variant of the Efficient Market Hypothesis: while market behavior may appear irrational in detail, it can often be simplified to supply-demand equilibrium on a macro scale. To this end, all farmers in a country are aggregated into a single representative agent whose goal is to maximize margin, assuming they behave like Homo Economicus.

To stabilize and simplify the model, several assumptions are made:

Stable weather conditions: No major climatic events (e.g., droughts, floods, locusts) disrupt planning. Extreme shocks can be integrated later via risk-adjusted costs or stochastic modeling.
Static domestic demand: Demand is considered constant in the short term and driven primarily by demographics and income. Industrial or livestock usage is assumed to evolve slowly.
No disruptive AgriTech breakthroughs: The yield function assumes current technology levels. Innovations like vertical farming or advanced GMOs, which could drastically alter yields, are excluded for tractability.
No cross-border arbitrage: The model assumes a closed economy. International trade frictions (tariffs, freight) are not considered, though they could be integrated later.
No logistics frictions: Crops are assumed to reach their destination efficiently. Overproduction is absorbed, and underproduction results in missed market opportunities — not spoilage.
Uniform quality and pricing: All crops of a given type are treated as homogenous, with no premium for organic, local, or high-grade produce.
heoretical Framework:

Objective:
Maximize the total economic profit from crop production based on endogenous market prices and supply levels.

Constraints:
Government policies (e.g., subsidies, quotas)
Crop-specific requirements, such as:
Rotation rules for annual crops
Longevity of perennials
Land availability (total arable land per season)
